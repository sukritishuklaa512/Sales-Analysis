# Sales-Analysis of pizza
The Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to provide an in-depth overview of pizza sales performance across various metrics, offering valuable insights for data-driven decision-making. At the top of the dashboard, key performance indicators such as total revenue ($817,860), average order value ($38.31), total pizzas sold (49,574), total orders (21,350), and average pizzas per order (2.32) offer a quick snapshot of business health. These figures allow stakeholders to gauge overall sales effectiveness and average transaction size, setting the stage for more detailed analysis.

The dashboard then breaks down ordering trends to highlight patterns in customer behavior. The **Daily Trend for Total Orders** bar chart displays order volumes across each day of the week, revealing peak demand on weekends, particularly on Friday and Saturday. In addition, the **Hourly Trend for Total Orders** line graph provides insights into the times when orders are most frequent, with noticeable spikes around lunch (12-1 pm) and evening hours (5-8 pm). This information is further summarized in the **Busiest Days & Times** section, making it clear that weekends and specific mealtimes drive the highest sales. These insights are essential for staffing and resource allocation to ensure efficient service during peak periods.

In terms of product performance, the dashboard provides a detailed look at sales by pizza category and size. The **% of Sales by Pizza Category** donut chart and **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category** bar chart show that "Classic" pizzas are the top performers, followed by "Supreme," "Veggie," and "Chicken" categories. Additionally, the **% of Sales by Pizza Size** pie chart indicates that larger pizzas are preferred, with large-sized pizzas contributing the highest percentage of total sales. This breakdown by category and size helps identify customer preferences, guiding menu adjustments and marketing strategies to maximize revenue.

A dedicated section for best and worst sellers offers further insights. The **Best & Worst Sellers** summary points out that the "Classic Deluxe" and "Chicken" pizzas are the top revenue generators, whereas the "Brie Carre" pizza ranks lowest in both orders and revenue. Detailed horizontal bar charts for the **Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold** and **Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold** provide a clear picture of customer favorites and underperforming items, helping decision-makers focus on promoting popular pizzas or re-evaluating less popular options.

Finally, the dashboard includes a **Timeline Slicer/Filter** for analyzing trends over time, allowing users to filter data across different periods, such as quarters and years. This feature supports trend analysis, enabling users to assess how sales fluctuate across seasons or years, which can inform promotional planning and inventory management.

Overall, this Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard integrates various visualizations to create a cohesive view of sales dynamics, customer preferences, and demand patterns. It is a powerful tool for optimizing business operations, from staffing and inventory to marketing and menu offerings, providing actionable insights for enhancing sales and customer satisfaction.
